      <p>My degree is applied technology. I am married and I have two children</p>
      <p>I am currently employed. I lead the IT function at an Organic company</p>
      <p>What I love about BYU-Idaho is the teachers and material</p>
      <p>Learning about web careers is an area I never explored before and I find it very interesting. My expectation is to learn and help to develop material for future projects I have in mind.</p>
      <p>I had been a member of the church for 50 years. My favorite quote is from David O. McKay “No other success [in life] can compensate for failure in the home.” and D&C 130:19</p>
      <p>I love sports, Tennis in particular. History is something that calls my attention and I love talking to my wife and children.</p>
