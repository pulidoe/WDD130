          <p class="home-paragraph-1">
            Potatoes are the third most important food crop globally, after
            wheat and rice, due to their caloric intake, high production, and
            easy handling. Its long history of use by man begins more than 7000
            years ago in the surroundings of Lake Titicaca, in southern Peru,
            where the ancient inhabitants started the domestication of wild
            potatoes, resulting in seven species and four subspecies of
            cultivated potatoes. , which to date include more than 4000
            varieties. Additionally, potatoes' remarkable biodiversity in our
            territory reaches almost one hundred species, which are wild
            relatives of cultivated potatoes. Maintaining wild relatives and the
            habitat where they thrive is critical. Thus, the Peruvian Andes are
            the areas with the most significant genetic richness of potatoes
            globally, this crop being a strategic component of Andean
            agrobiodiversity. food!

          <h2 class="home-headline-2">The Potato traveling around the world</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            After the arrival of the Spanish in America, the Potato was
            introduced into new territories (Europe and Asia) and is currently
            cultivated in more than one hundred countries. We must not forget
            that after it arrived in Europe and Asia, it saved millions of
            people from famine, and to date, these continents are the primary
            potato producers worldwide. Its value is so significant that
            countries on the Asian continent, such as China, currently the
            largest potato producer globally, where rice cultivation is so
            entrenched, are migrating areas from rice cultivation to potato
            cultivation, considered more nutritious and with greater efficiency.
