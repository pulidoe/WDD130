      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Potatoes are the third most important food crop globally, after wheat
        and rice, due to their caloric intake, high production, and easy
        handling. Its long history of use by man begins more than 7000 years ago
        in the surroundings of Lake Titicaca, in southern Peru, where the
        ancient inhabitants started the domestication of wild potatoes,
        resulting in seven species and four subspecies of cultivated potatoes. ,
        which to date include more than 4000 varieties. Additionally, potatoes'
        remarkable biodiversity in our territory reaches almost one hundred
        species, which are wild relatives of cultivated potatoes. Maintaining
        wild relatives and the habitat where they thrive is critical. Thus, the
        Peruvian Andes are the areas with the most significant genetic richness
        of potatoes globally, this crop being a strategic component of Andean
        agrobiodiversity. food!

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This site is dedicated to any person willing to learn more about natural
        producst use for home made dishes. We are publishing this material and
        would like your contribution visiting the sites where the potatoes are
        grown by peruvian families. Consuming the products or just sending us
        your suggestions. Probably you are use to very few type of potatoes. Now
        you may be wondering Why those many different type of potatoes? Why so
        many different colors? What is the purpose of those colors? What is the
        nutritional values of them? Is it related to my digestion? Those and
        many other questions we will try to anwser based on the cientific
        studies performed by those that study the genetic code of the potatoes.
        Every year there is a world competition in France. Peru has been awarded
        almost all of them over the last 10 years.

      <h3>History of the Potato in Peru</h3>
      <p>
        Family farming in Peru represents one of the most important and
        culturally relevant activities in our country, and the Potato is a
        fundamental axis of this family farming. The thousands of potato
        conservationist men and women have allowed us to maintain our
        agrobiodiversity. This Baseline must become an instrument that values
        the work they have developed over the years. Potatoes are the third most
        important food crop globally, after wheat and rice, due to their caloric
        intake, high production, and easy handling. Its long history of use by
        man begins more than 7000 years ago in the surroundings of Lake
        Titicaca, in southern Peru, where the ancient inhabitants started the
        domestication of wild potatoes, resulting in seven species and four
        subspecies of cultivated potatoes. , which to date include more than
        4000 varieties. Additionally, there is a remarkable biodiversity of
        potatoes in our territory that reaches almost one hundred species, which
        are wild relatives of cultivated potatoes. Maintaining wild relatives
        and the habitat where they thrive is critical. Thus, the Peruvian Andes
        are the areas with the most significant genetic richness of potatoes
        globally, this crop being a strategic component of Andean
        agrobiodiversity.
      </p>
      <h3>Reaching Europe, Asia, and the World</h3>
      <p>
        After the arrival of the Spanish in America, the Potato was introduced
        into new territories (Europe and Asia) and is currently cultivated in
        more than one hundred countries. We must not forget that after it
        arrived in Europe and Asia, it saved millions of people from famine, and
        to date, these continents are the primary potato producers worldwide.
        Its value is so significant that countries on the Asian continent, such
        as China, currently the largest potato producer globally, where rice
        cultivation is so entrenched, are migrating areas from rice cultivation
        to potato cultivation, considered more nutritious and with greater
        efficiency. In irrigation.
      </p>
      <h3>The Potato can get sick</h3>
      <p>
        The Irish were the first to recognize its high nutritional value.
        Potatoes became the staple food of the Irish in the early 1600s; most
        people depended on them for their existence. When late blight disease
        came to Ireland from the United States, it caused a national famine from
        1845 to 1848, causing the death of almost a million people and the mass
        emigration abroad of a million more. The diversity of species and
        varieties of this crop provides us with more productive, pest-resistant,
        and resilient alternatives to face the effects of climate change that
        put food security at risk. Unfortunately, however, potato genetic
        resources, and agrobiodiversity in general, are being lost or degraded
        at an alarming rate due to the abandonment of the field and the lack of
        market opportunities and incentives for their cultivation.
      </p>
      <h3>The Potato in the United States</h3>
      <p>
        Potatoes were introduced to the United States in 1719 from supplies
        brought in from Ireland and were initially grown in New Hampshire.
        Today, the United States produces more than 420 million quintals (cwt)
        of potatoes annually on about 1.1 million acres, worth about $ 3.5 to
        4.0. billion dollars. The Northeast states combined reach about 100,000
        acres per year; Pennsylvania potato supplies are for processing
        (primarily for potato chips) and fresh produce (or eat-safe) markets.
        Eventually, perhaps in the early 1800s, the beloved Potato found its
        place in Thanksgiving traditions. So this holiday season, when you eat
        your mashed Potato, add Andean civilization to your thank you list.
      </p>
      <h3>The recent findings of Potato</h3>
      <p>
        In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
        Sciences, archaeologists from the University of California report the
        discovery of direct evidence: microscopic remains of what appears to be
        Potato in ancient grinding tools from southern Peru. The remains date
        back to 3400 BC. C. The study authors looked for microscopic grains of
        starch in stone tools collected from an ancient highland site called
        Jiskairumoko in the Titicaca basin of southern Peru. They suspected that
        these tools were used to peel potatoes.

        Your contribution is so significant! Over the years, we had food going
        to the supermarket and buying the food. What should happen if the
        supermarket can no longer receive the product from the farmers! Yes, we
        would have a Famine. That's why we need your support in farming.
