            After the arrival of the Spanish in America, the Potato was
            introduced into new territories (Europe and Asia) and is currently
            cultivated in more than one hundred countries. We must not forget
            that after it arrived in Europe and Asia, it saved millions of
            people from famine, and to date, these continents are the primary
            potato producers worldwide. Its value is so significant that
            countries on the Asian continent, such as China, currently the
            largest potato producer globally, where rice cultivation is so
            entrenched, are migrating areas from rice cultivation to potato
            cultivation, considered more nutritious and with greater efficiency.
            In irrigation.

          <h2 class="history-headline-2">Arriving to the US</h2>
          <p class="history-paragraph-2">
            Potatoes were introduced to the United States in 1719 from supplies
            brought in from Ireland and were initially grown in New Hampshire.
            Today, the United States produces more than 420 million quintals
            (cwt) of potatoes annually on about 1.1 million acres, worth about $
            3.5 to 4.0. billion dollars. The Northeast states combined reach
            about 100,000 acres per year; Pennsylvania potato supplies are for
            processing (primarily for potato chips) and fresh produce (or
            eat-safe) markets. Eventually, perhaps in the early 1800s, the
            beloved Potato found its place in Thanksgiving traditions. So this
            holiday season, when you eat your mashed Potato, add Andean
            civilization to your thank you list.
